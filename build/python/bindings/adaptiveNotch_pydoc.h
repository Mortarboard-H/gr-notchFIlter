Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of notchFilter::adaptiveNotch.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, notchFilter::adaptiveNotch's constructor is in a private implementation class. notchFilter::adaptiveNotch::make is the public interface for creating new instances.
